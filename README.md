# Zipf Law Analysis

## About The Project

In linguistics, according to this law, if the words in any written text are sorted according to decreasing frequency (ie from the most used to the least used), the resulting ranking list with a single ranking number, then the frequency number will be a fixed number of its time. This can be more easily expressed if the frequency is 1 / N for a word with sequence number N. It is used 2 times more than the word used in the second row and 3 times more than the word used in the third row. Is this really true?


This repo shows you the demonstrability of this law.
